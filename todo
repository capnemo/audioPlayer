Add delete to all classes to remove the copy constructor and
assignment operator. Done.
Add a call to lockedQ to accept a function pointer that will
free the type. There should be a function to take the object of the
type T back. Not the greatest design decision. But the alternative is 
far more messy.
Adding const to function declarations and function arguments.
